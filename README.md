# B-Active
This is the repository for my final year project, B-Active. This application will be associated as a fitness application which will provide the user with multiple features in order to encourage physical activity. The application will be developed on Android Studio Code and will allow users to track-calories, time their runs/workouts, create workouts, count their steps etc. Github will assist in maintaining version control so any changes made can be easily pushed to the repository and any mistakes can easily be "rolled back".
